# Simple Compiler

**Status:** Academic Project

This project implements a basic compiler for a small custom language. 
It includes lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and basic semantic validation.

The goal of this project is educational, focusing on understanding the core 
principles of compiler design rather than performance or production use.
